Heimdall is able to see a person's next moves and intent by locking eyes, even to the point of
being able to read another person's mind and thoughts. However, this precognitive capacity
is based on the extent of the observed party also being consciously aware of the moves they
are about to make, diminishing Heimdall's ability to anticipate them if they were randomly
executed and not necessarily planned. Therefore, he can be struck through pure chance;
Brok notes that one can bypass the god's foresight by overwhelming his senses via forcing 
Heimdall to focus on more than one target at once. Hence the Draupnir Spear, able to
near-infinitely multiply itself and having several of its copies thrown at the target's
general location by the wielder from multiple trajectories.
